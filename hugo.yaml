      I am full stack engineer and tech enthusiast and am passionate about building reliable, performant applications. After
      working in the industry for a few years and continuing studies after university, I've begun to take an interest in the
      intersection of tech, history, and the broader political economy. 

      On my slice of the internet, you will find information technology I'm working with along with analysis around
      economics, power, and technology.
